SOSC 1470,The Political and Economic Development of Modern Japan,3 Credit(s),,,,,,SOSC 1000D,,The rapid economic modernization and building of a modern state in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 has long been considered a typical case of successful economic and political development. Japan#s success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its $learning from the west$. The lack of appreciation of Japan#s indigenous resources of economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan#s development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). Against this historical background@ it emphasizes multiple possibilities in the political development of Japan after the Meiji Restoration@ foreign aggression was by no means the only path of Japan#s political development.
